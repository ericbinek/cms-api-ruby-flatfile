# Roadmap

The goal is a CMS where content is structured, schema.org-native, and served through a strict, predictable API that is machine-readable by design. That makes it a clean substrate for automation and LLM-driven workflows.

This is a work-in-progress project (v0.1.1). The roadmap is deliberately loose, will grow, and the order can change based on what proves useful. Nothing here is a promise.

## Recently shipped

- CRUD over a schema.org-aligned vocabulary, backed by flat-file JSON storage
- Reference embedding on single-resource reads
- Type-aware sorting, pagination, filtering, and ETag caching
- A named, consistent error format with content-type enforcement
- Session-based authentication with per-role permissions and a publication workflow
- Per-IP rate limiting and field-aware input sanitization

## Planned

- Referential integrity on writes, so a reference cannot point at a missing record
- More entity types as the vocabulary grows

## Considering

- Database-backed storage variants
